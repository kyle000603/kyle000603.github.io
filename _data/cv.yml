        - title: ESPNet
          contents:
            - Train speech recognition model with AIhub KSponSpeech dataset(1000hr). By researching the ESPnet and Speech Recognition(SR), learned that SR integrates the idea of ‘alignment’. SR networks can vary by how they define the method of alignment.
        - title: Android App using Speech Recognition
          contents:
            - Implemented Android speech recognition app using Google speech-to-text API (Google Cloud) with Java and Kotlin. Learned the requirement of a small model that can run on the device offline. Small on-device models are more efficient because of the cost of communication, computing delay, and computing power.
        - title: RNNoise(Speech Enhancement)
          contents:
            - Train the RNNoise model and integrate it to use it on hearing aids. My primary job was to decrease the delay of the model from 20ms to 10ms and change the sample rate from 48k to 16k with code analysis and research about psychoacoustics. Also, integrate the RNNoise model from Keras into PyTorch to increase the train speed.
